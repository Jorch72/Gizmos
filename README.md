Gizmos
========

A Minecraft mod of the "anything goes" persuasion.

##Content##
+ several forms of explosives
+ a machine to hide items in any other item
+ devices to speed up and throw anything that moves
+ machines that will quickly and painlessly switch out your ~~victim's~~ inventory
+ a fire extinguisher that works on blazes, including the fireball-flinging kind
+ a block that you can reach through to use whatever is behind it
+ a tweak that allows nether portals to be made in any size or shape

##SimpleLoader##

It ded now. Revert if you cared; I replaced it with a much-improved abstraction.

##The future##

I use https://gist.github.com/planetguy32/6528825 as a place to put any plans and/or wild ideas.

##Binary builds##

New versions can be found on my CurseForge page at http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/planetguy_gizmos/files/

The ones in MC version folders should all work for that version. There's a fair chance that the latest build won't work at all, since it's never tested.

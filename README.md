Gizmos
========

A Minecraft mod of the "anything goes" persuasion.

##Content##
+ several forms of explosives (planetguy.gizmos.gravitybomb, planetguy.gizmos.timebomb, planetguy.gizmos.inserter (indirectly), planetguy.gizmos.CES (not in a working state))
+ a machine to hide items in any other item (planetguy.gizmos.inserter)
+ devices to speed up and throw anything that moves (planetguy.gizmos.motiontools)
+ devices to quickly ~~lag you to death~~ remove adjacent groups trees or mining hazards. Warranty void if used in jungle biomes. (planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemDeforester, planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemMinersLighter)
+ a device to make machines work faster (planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemBlockTicker)
+ a device to delete the dastardly device of destruction that is the Fork Bomb (planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemBombDefuser)
+ machines that will quickly and painlessly switch out your ~~victim's~~ inventory (planetguy.gizmos.invUtils)
+ a fire extinguisher that works on blazes, including the fireball-flinging kind (planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemFireExtinguisher)
+ a tool that lets you place blocks but works as a pickaxe, saving inventory space (planetguy.gizmos.tool.ItemBuildTool)
+ a block that you can reach through to use whatever is behind it (planetguy.invUtils.BlockTelekinesisCatalyst)
+ a tweak that lets modpack users raise the relative occurance of vanilla Minecraft flowers, so they aren't swamped by mod flowers (planetguy.sltweaks.FlowerFix)
+ a tweak that allows nether portals to be made in any size or shape (planetguy.sltweaks.PortalLiberator)
+ lotsa stuff that doesn't work/was a bad idea to begin with

##SimpleLoader##

Since some server administrators might want to disable some Gizmos items for various reasons, Gizmos has a rather special loading setup, SimpleLoader, which is designed to allow each item to be disabled separately (also disabling its dependencies). The loading infrastructure can be found in the package planetguy.simpleLoader.

Note: This doesn't yet work in a production environment and will probably be changed from reflection-based to a code generator.

##The future##

I tend to keep my plans (and wild ideas that are way beyone me) here.

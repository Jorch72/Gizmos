Gizmos
======

A technologially oriented Minecraft mod that adds several ways for you to blow up your friends:
  Time bomb: Explodes after a set time
  Fork bomb: Time bomb that duplicates when broken
  Gravity bomb: Bomb that falls if there is nothing under it and explodes when it hits the ground
  Tunnel bomb: Gravity bomb that explodes repeatedly whenever it hits bottom
  Deforestator: Creates magical fire that burns only trees and similar blocks.
  Miner's lighter: Creates magical fire that burns only gravel and lava. Don't use in the nether.
  Temporal Dislocator: Causes target block to experience several minutes of time flow instantaneously.
  Spy lab: Allows hiding things inside tools. Hide gunpowder or spider eyes in your neighbor's tools and let the show begin! (Watch from far away. No, really.)
  Accelerator: Anything standing on this bad boy has its velocity INCREASED.
  Launcher: Sends anything that passes through it flying upwards.
  Collider core: It no work yet. May be removed eventually unless someone really wants it.


This repo also includes FlowerFix which was too small for its own repository. FlowerFix allows the generation rates of vanilla flowers to be increased. Useful to stop them being lost between mod flowers adding themselves to bone meal, or for equalizing red and yellow flower spawn rates.
